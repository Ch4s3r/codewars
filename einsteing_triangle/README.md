Given a triangle of odd numbers, with an assumption of the row having a 1 index and the column a 0 index, write a function that given the matrix position of the element it returns the correct value.

          1
        3   5
      7   9   11
    13  15  17  19

In the above, 1 would be [1,0] and 9 would be [3,1].
